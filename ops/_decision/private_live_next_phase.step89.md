# Private Live — Next Phase Decision (Step 89)
CreatedAt: 2025-12-22T12:56:05Z

## Current signals (auto-collected)
- Step 60 build flag: false
- Step 87 build ok: unknown
- Step 86 report present: true
- Step 87 report present: true
- Step 88 readiness present: true

## Default decision (safe)
**Decision:** iterate

**Rationale:** Build appears failing or unknown; prioritize fixing stability issues before expanding cohort.

## Operator override (edit this file only if you want)
If you override:
- set Decision to: iterate / expand / soft-launch
- add 1–3 bullet reasons
- note date/time and who approved

## If decision = iterate
- Use Step 81 backlog + Step 82 tracker
- Re-run stability verification (Step 86) after fixes

## If decision = expand
- Follow Step 88 checklist + cohort rollout plan
- Log observations (76), feedback (77), friction (78)

## If decision = soft-launch
- Requires: stable build + validated private phase outcomes + explicit SFVF gate approval
