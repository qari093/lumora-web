# Lumora — Private Live Tester Onboarding (Step 74)

## Access
You will receive an invite link from the Lumora team.

- First visit sets an access cookie automatically.
- If access fails, the team can apply access via the helper endpoint.

## What to test (10 minutes)
1) Open the app and confirm it loads without blocking.
2) Confirm portals open:
   - GMAR: `/gmar`
   - Video Generation: `/video-gen`
   - Feed: `/feed`
   - Social: `/social`
   - Creator: `/creator`

3) Splash behavior:
- Should be skippable and must never block.
- Reduced Motion (OS setting) should shorten/disable effects.

## Report format (copy/paste)
- Device model:
- OS version:
- Browser:
- URL visited:
- What happened:
- Screenshot/screen recording (if possible):

## Safety
- Do not share invite links publicly.
- Do not upload personal/sensitive data during Private Live.
