# Cohort Rollout Plan (Step 88)

## Cohorts (suggested)
- Cohort A: +5 users
- Cohort B: +10 users
- Cohort C: +10 users
- Cohort D: +25 users

## Notes
- Use separate invite batches.
- Keep a record of who is in each cohort (DO NOT commit real emails).
- If any stop condition is hit, pause expansion and focus on fixes only.
