# Lumora — Portal Value Assessment (Step 80)

Use this after you have real tester sessions.

## Inputs to consider
- Portal usage (Step 79)
- Friction/drop-off logs (Step 78)
- Portal feedback (Step 77)
- Observation logs (Step 76)

## Per-portal decision table
For each portal, choose:
- Value: high / medium / low
- Reason: usage, feedback, friction, confusion, crash, etc.
- Action: keep, polish, pause, remove-from-nav (private), re-test

## Notes
- Low usage alone is not enough if portal is a strategic pillar.
- If portal causes friction/crashes: pause for Private Live and re-test later.
