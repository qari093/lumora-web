# Lumora — Improvement Validation (Step 85)

Compare BEFORE vs AFTER for the same testers.

## Inputs
- Friction logs (Step 78)
- Portal feedback (Step 77)
- Retest sessions (Step 84)
- Critical blockers tracker (Step 82)

## Validation checklist
- [ ] P0 blockers reduced (count before vs after)
- [ ] Time-to-first-usable improved or unchanged
- [ ] Fewer repeated complaints in portal feedback
- [ ] No new crash loops/regressions

## Notes
- Keep changes minimal (feature freeze still active).
- Document any regression immediately and revert if needed.
