# Polaroid (Color-First) — Phase 1 Plan (Bootstrap)

## Goal
Ship the next minimal, measurable iteration after Phase 0 proof:
- Keep **one-blade** UX: color tap → instant polaroid → save
- Preserve Phase-0 baseline behavior
- Add only Phase-1 safety + measurement + stability hardening

## Phase-1 Deliverables (Step 01 only)
1) Phase-1 guard marker + status lines in `.lumora_resume_marker`
2) Phase-1 docs directory created and committed
3) Phase-1 runfile updated (non-breaking, used for quick checks)

## Next Step
Proceed to **POST_MEGA_PHASE1_STEP02** (implementation steps will follow).
