# Post-Mega Phase 0 — Polaroid MVP (Color-Tap Only)

## What we are building (72h max)
- One screen: color palette
- One action: tap a color
- One result: instant “Emotional Polaroid” artifact (generated image)
- Optional (only after artifact appears): add 0–1 word
- Local only: no accounts, no cloud sync, no social features, no prompts to share

## How we test (humans > analytics)
- Day-1/2: test with 5 people (≥2 non-close contacts)
- Ask one question: “Would you open this tomorrow?”
- Measure Day-2 retention (opened again next day)

## Kill gate (ruthless)
- If Day-2 retention < 20% → stop and pivot the artifact (not features)
- If ≥ 20% → earn the right to build Phase-2 (Weekly Digest)

## Rules (locked)
- No feature creep: only color-tap → artifact.
- No input-method choice (no photo yet).
- No onboarding screens.
- No “education”, no “interpretations”.
- Privacy by default: local storage only.
