Step 25.9 — LumaSpace state banner component created
Usage: import { LumaSpaceStateBanner } from "@/app/_components/lumaspace/state-banner";
Then mount <LumaSpaceStateBanner compact /> or <LumaSpaceStateBanner /> in /lumaspace or /me/space layouts.
No type-check script found, skipping TS validation.
Optimization notes:
- Later: lift LumaSpace state into a shared store or RSC to avoid repeated fetches.
- Consider SWR/React Query if banner is widely reused.
